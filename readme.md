# image classification between cat and dog using both pytorch and tensorflow 2 using resnet and inception

PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Whatâ€™s the difference? Both are open source Python libraries that use graphs to perform numerical computation on data.
Which library to use depends on your own style and preference, your data and model, and your project goal.
## Pre- requests:
- python
- numpy
- tensorflow
- pytorch



```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
```
## Dataset
 download the rdatasets from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

## Usage
i used rock paper scissors dataset for visualization.
I have used inception for the tensorflow file and resnet for pytorch file.
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
Don't forget to rename the dataset path in the codes.
